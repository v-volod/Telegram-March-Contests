# Telegram-March-Contests
Simple chart drawing library for the official [Telegram coding competition](https://t.me/contest/6).

The library draws simple charts based on the input data provided by the Telegram Contests team.

It was written in pure Swift without the usage of any third-party libraries or frameworks. 
The implementation of the chart drawing is based on the `CoreGraphics` and `CoreAnimation` frameworks.
